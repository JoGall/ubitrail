    @+!+ error messages: return visible errors from command line usage (help currently printed last, so cannot see error message in the terminal without scrolling up)

 => @++!++ tell how many territ are present in the overview
# => @++!++ uses mask to define territories.
# => @++!++ optimise decorator
# => position relative to width only
# => @+++!+ protection against overlaping area
# => @++!+++ Area from file (png)
# => @++!+++ Make a constructor that can take files as areas
# => @+++!+++ Understand why some likelihood values are positive
# => @+++!+++ Make a result file header (time/date/ input file,areas...........)
# => @+++!+ Mass center not center of bounding box !
# => @ make labels with 2 digits
# => @++! Training rounds as a variable
# => @++!+++  Merge contours when detected
# => @++!+++  Exclude bigcontours

BENCHMARCK:

    @++! GUI vs CL
    @++! see what hapend if the number of thread is down and number of area high


ASSISTANT:
    @+!+ add header in order to use pango markup
    @+++!++ remember path
    @++!++ review sensitivity definition when inverted
    @+!+ include links to user manual
    @! startProcessing = better button
    @+! estethic buttons
    @+! images
    @+! icon
    @+! tooltips
# => @! allow user to go forward from experimental definition screen with 'Default' area type without having to first change area type
# => @! MAKE ANOTHER QUIT WHEN PROCESSOR IS FINISHED
# => @+++! Quiting option
# => @+++!+++ Previewer


DISPLAY:

    @++!++ About ubitrail
    @++! click on display -> area

    @++!++ save preview picture

General:

    @+++!+ Document the code
    @+++!+ HelpButton
    @+++!+ Version
    @++!++ ErrorPrinter(VIDEO_WONT_INIT);
    @++!++ Define territories in mask
    @+!+ print number of territory in output matrix;
    @+!+ print source of mask...
    @+!+ error closing GUI when using mask ["(ubitrail:3363): Gtk-CRITICAL **: IA__gtk_assistant_set_page_complete: assertion `child != NULL' failed"]

Quitting mechanism
    @++!++ better closing mechanism (more robust)
    @++!++ send notification when finnished

# => @+++! make a clean finishing mechanism
# => @++!+ make gui start without assistant
